# Double Hashing vs Binary Search Tree (Performance Evaluation)

The dataset was created using a python script. To evaluate the performance and show comparison between Double Hashing & Binary Search Tree data structure, we wrote two C++ programs for Double Hashing and BST. We then used the dataset to compare the average probe count of both Double Hashing and Binary Search Tree.
